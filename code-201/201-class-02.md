## Intro to HTML: Continued-

**1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?**

**2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML?**  
There are 6 levels of headings in HTML.

**3. What are some uses for the < sup> and < sub> elements?**  
The `<sup>` element makes a character smaller and aligns it towards the top of the line. Like squaring and cubing numbers for example.

> e.g.  
> `5<sup>2</sup>` would show as 5 squared.

The `<sub>` element does the same as above but instead of aligning to the top of the line it aligns to the bottom. This presents as chemical formulas for example.

> e.g  
> `H<sub>2</sub>O` would show as the chemical formula for water.

**4. When using the < abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?**

## Learn CSS

**1. What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?**

**2. Why should we avoid using inline styles?**  
It is best practise to separate our concerns, meaning to have separate pages for different types of coding like html, css and JS.  
This makes the code easier to read and edit as well as making it less complicated and prone to errors.

**3. Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:**

> h2 {color: black; padding: 5px;}

- **What is representing the selector?**  
  h2 is the selector which attaches the style in the style sheet to the h2 element in the html sheet.

- **Which components are the CSS declarations?**  
  The CSS declaration is the color and padding components which target these aspects of the style and allow the coder to attach values to them.

- **Which components are considered properties?**  
  The components of the above code that are considered properties are the values given to the declarations like black being the colour and 5px given to the padding.

## Learn JS

### JavaScript Basics

**1. What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?**  
A string.

**2. List 4 types of JavaScript operators.**  
i. Arithmetic Operators  
ii. Comparison Operators  
iii. Logical Operators  
iv. 4

**3. Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.**

### Decisions in your code- Conditionals

**1. An if statement checks a** and if it evaluates to \_**, then the code block will execute.**

**2. What is the use of an else if?**

**3. List 3 different types of comparison operators.**

**4. What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?**  
**&&** means 'and' joining two components together.
