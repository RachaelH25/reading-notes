**1. What is control flow?**  
    - *Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.*  
    - *Code is run in order from the the first to the last line, unless the computer runs structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.*

**2. What is a JavaScript function?**  
    - *In JS, a function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.*  
    - *These are executed when they are invoked.*
> function yourName() {  
        user= prompt("Hi, What is your name?");  
    return document.write("Hi " + user);  
}

**3. What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?**  
    - *To invoke or call a function in JS means to implement the start of that functions execution within the script.*
  
**4. What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?**  
    - *In JS the parenthesis () are used for function calls, to surround conditional statements, or for grouping to enforce Order of Operations.*  
    - *A function cannot be invoked without parenthesis/() Operators.*
