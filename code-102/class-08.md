**1. What is an expression in JavaScript?**  

- *In JS, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value.*  
- *There are two types of expressions:  
  - *those that have side effects (like assigning values)*  
    > E.g. x = 7. Where the = operator is used to assign a value of 7 to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to 7.
  - *those that only evaluate*  
    > E.g. 3 + 4. Where the + operator is used to add 3 and 4 together to produce a value of 7.  
    However, it is not part of a bigger construct anf the results will be discarded as a programmer mistake because it produces no effect.

**2. Why would we use a loop in our code?**  

- *Using a loop within our code gives us a way to quickly and easily do something repeatedly.*

**3. When does a for loop stop executing?**  
> for (initialization; condition; afterthought){  
  statement  
  }

- *A for loop stops executing when the conditions mentioned are met.*  

**4. How many times will a while loop execute?**  
> while (condition){  
  statement  
}

- *A while loop will execute until the condition becomes false and the statement in the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.*
