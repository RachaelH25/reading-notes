## Let
>
> Let is used for times when you want to change the value of a variable later in the script.  
You can only declare a Let variable once, the value can be reassigned but the variable cannot be redeclared.

## Const
>
> Const is used to declare a variable that stays constant and will not be changed anywhere in the script.  
Unlike Let variables that can originally be left without a value, Const needs a value when the variable is declared.
