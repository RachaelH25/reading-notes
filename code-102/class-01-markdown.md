# Markdown Reflection  
[Home](/README.md)

Markdown is a markup language that uses text symbols such as hyphens and asterisks to indicate the structure of the page.  
Some benefits of using Markdown are that it can be used across different operating systems and as such are also reliable over time as Markup-formatted text can still be read using a text editing application regardless of whether or not the original technology becomes outdated.  
It is in widespread use in websites including GitHub and Reddit and can also be used to create a variety of different things, including:  

- email messages
- presentations
- documents
- websites, etc.

## Markdown syntax  

Here are some of the more commonly used features and how text symbols are used to achieve them.

- Headings:  
          - # is used infront of text to create a Heading using Markdown.  
          - There are six layers of headings and to indicate which heading you want to use there should be that many # symbols before the text.  
          - e.g- # Markdown Reflection is used for the first heading on this page and ## Markdown Syntax is used for the second heading which is differentiated by smaller text.  
               A difference is seen again when you reach ### Heading 3 as from this heading onwards the text is smaller still and does not have a line underneath.  

- Bold and Italic Text:  
                       - *are used to create bold and italic texts.
                       - **Bold** to make text bold insert two asterisk before and after the necessary word/words.  
-*Italic* to make text italic insert on asterisk before and after the necessary word/words.  
                       - ***Bold and Italic*** to make text both bold and italic insert three asterisk on either side of the necessary word/words.  

- Links:  
       - Image- ![alt text](linked image url)  
After the ! write alt text in the square brackets to explain the content of the image, this will display if/when there is an issue with the image and can also be used to make the websites more accesible. Then in the parenthese paste the relevant url for the image.  
       - Hyperlink- [HERE](website url)  
Text that is to be shown as the hyperlink on the website should be entered into the square brackets followed by the relevant url in parentheses.  

- Lists:  
        - Unordered lists are created using symbols such as -, + and * before each element of the list. When the Enter key is clicked another bullet point will appear on the next line to continue the list. However, be consistent with the symbols used or they will not be read as a list.  
        - Ordered lists are created in a similar way but instead using numbers. eg. 1. red 2. yellow.  
When the Enter key is clicked the next number in the sequence will appear automatically on the next line to continue the list.
