Hi! I'm Rachael and I'll be talking about what a Growth Mindset is and how best to keep yourself in this mindset.  Visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/RachaelH25?tab=repositories) for more.  

### What it is?  

First, it may be useful to say **what it is not**, which is a Fixed Mindset. A Fixed Mindset is when you believe that success can only come from inherent intelligence and talent and so further development and learning will have no effect on chances of success.  
On the other hand, a Growth Mindset, is the belief that a person's abilities can be developed and improved upon with continued learning and perseverance. Although inherent intelligence and talent can be a good place to start they are not essential qualities that would prevent you from progress or success where you not to have an abundance of either.

### Three ways to keep in a Growth Mindset  

1. Persevere- Trying new things can be hard but if you give up too soon you will never realise how much you can do. Ask for help if you need, it is not a sign of weakness it is a sign that you are invested and what to improve yourself.
2. Regular review and check ins- Regularly review your work and progress. This will help you to not only see where you may have gone wrong and so what you need to work on to help you progress but also to see how far you have come. Try to make criticisms constructive. They're meant to help, not hinder your learning.
3. Don't compare yourself to others- Everyone has their own ability level and timeline. Yours are your own and you don't need to concern yourself with where others are in their journey. Be kind to yourself and focus on your own learning.
