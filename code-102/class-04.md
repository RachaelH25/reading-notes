2. What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?  
    i. *Opening tags.*  
    ii. *Closing tags*  
    iii. *Content of the element between tags*  
3. What is it called when you give an element extra information?
    - ***Attributes** contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear to the users in the actual content.*  
4. What is a semantic element?
    - ***Semantic elements** are coding elements that hold meaning, **e.g header, footer, article, etc**.*
    - An example of a non-semantic tag is **div** which has no meaning but is read by the browser as targetting a section to edit the layout or structure.*
