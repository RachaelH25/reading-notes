## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)  

1. What is the purpose of CSS?  

- *CSS is used to control how your html looks in the browser, how it is presented to users.*

2. What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?  
    i. ***External CSS**- in this case the html file must include a reference linking it to an external stylesheet file. This is inserted inside a < link > element, inside the head section. It can be written in any text editor but must be saved with a .css extension.*  
    ii. ***Internal CSS**- This is when the css is included within a < style > element inside the head section of the html.*  
    iii. ***Inline CSS**- This is primarily used when applying style editting to singular elements. Achieved by adding a style attribute containing any css property to the relevant element.*

3. Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all < p > elements red text.  
    - *< p style="color:red;" >< /p>*  
    - *This example is using Inline CSS to add an atribute to the < p > element.*

### REMINDER- spaces are included in html and css examples where they usually would not be to be read correctly by Markdown
