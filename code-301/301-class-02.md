## State and Props

### React Lifecycle

**1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the 'render' or the ''componentDidMount'?**

'render' should happen first as during the Mounting phase render occurs after getDerivedStateFromProps and after componentDidMount.

**2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?**

The first thing to occur in the lifecycle of React is calling the constructor as that happens before it is mounted.

**3. Put the following things in they order they happen...**

> Constructor -> render -> React Updates -> componentDidMount -> componentWillUnmount.

**4. What does componentDidMount do?**

_componentDidMount_ is invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree).  
Initialisation that requires DOM nodes should go here. If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request.  
You can call setState() immediately in this method to trigger and extra rendering, but this will happen before the browser updates the screen.

### React State vs Props

**1. What type of things can you pass in the props?**

data.

**2. What is the big difference between props and states?**

The big difference between props and states is that props handled outside of the component and so is passed into a component and state is handled within that component.  
Props must be updated outside of the component whereas state has to be edited inside the component.  
If handling a piece of information inside a component only not in a parent for example then you need to use state but if it's handled outside the component it needs to be passed in via props.

**3. When do we re-render our applictaion?**

We re-render our application when there is something that needs to be updated based on what the user has done.  
State is used for when we have something that needs to be re-rendered and updated, for example when we have a counter.

**4. What are some of the examples of the things that we could store in a state?**

-   Counters
-   Values for Forms (checkboxes, name input, etc)
