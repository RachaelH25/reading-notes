## Passing Functions as Props

### Lists and Keys

**1. What does .map() return?**

.map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

**2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?**

> Example.  
> const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
> const listItems = numbers.map((number) => {number}
> );

**3. Each list item needs a unique**... **_[KEY]_**

**4. What is the purpose of a key?**

The purpose of a key is to help React identify which items have changed, are added or removed.  
They should be given to the elements inside the array to give each element a stable identity.

### The Spread Operator

**1. What is the spread operator?**

The spread operator is an ellipsis (...) that is used to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.

> When ...arr is used in the function call, it 'expands'(spreads) an iterable object arr into the list of separate arguments.

**2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do?**

It can be useful when:

1. Copying an array
2. Using Math functions
3. Adding an item to a list
4. Combining objects.
5. More at [spread operators](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)

**3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.**

> const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]  
> const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]  
> const ourArray = [... myArray,...yourArray]  
> console.log(...ourArray)  
> // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩

**4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.**

> const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']  
> const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]  
> console.log(fewMoreFruit)  
> // Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]

**5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.**

> const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}  
> const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}  
> const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}  
> console.log(objectThree)  
> // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }  
> const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}  
> objectFour.laugh()  
> // 😂😂😂😂😂

### How to Pass Functions Between Components

**1. In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?**

**2. In your own words, what does the _increment_ function do?**

**3. How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?**

**4. How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?**
